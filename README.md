Acaree Virtual Clinic Backend Infrastructure

Overview

Welcome to the Acaree Virtual Clinic Backend Infrastructure. Our platform is designed to revolutionize the healthcare industry by offering a seamless, digital solution for virtual clinics. Currently, in Phase 1 of our rollout, we are proud to introduce our digital appointment booking system. This system is developed as a microservice, focusing on delivering a user-friendly, efficient, and reliable way for patients to book appointments online.

Features
The digital appointment booking system includes the following key features:

Doctor Selection: Patients can browse and select a doctor from a comprehensive list of healthcare professionals. Each doctor's profile includes their specialization, qualifications, and available slots, enabling patients to make informed decisions.

Appointment Type Selection: Depending on their needs, patients can choose the type of appointment they require. The system supports various appointment types, catering to different medical consultations and services.

Date and Time Slot Selection: Patients have the flexibility to choose their preferred date and time slot based on the doctor's availability. This feature ensures that appointments are scheduled at a convenient time for both the patient and the healthcare provider.

Reason for Appointment: Patients can input the reason for their appointment, allowing doctors to prepare for the consultation beforehand. This feature enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the medical consultation.

Booking Confirmation: Upon completing the booking process, patients receive a confirmation page with all the details of their appointment. The system also sends a confirmation email, ensuring that patients have all the necessary information for their appointment.
